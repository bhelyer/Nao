A command line game of tic tac toe.
(This really is as boring as it seems.)

I'd somehow never implemented a minimax AI so I spent a few hours doing so.
I decided to play around with making the game representation immutable (except for in the playGame function).

Used [this page](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/javagame_tictactoe_ai.html) from Chua Hock-Chuan as a reference for the AI stuff.

What else? Oh right, licence. Uh, here:
